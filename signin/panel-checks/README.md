# The control panel's browser checks

From the thread "Symphony control website" of the claude.ai Project "symphony", 2026-10-16. These
checks ran in that thread's session while it built "Sign in with GitHub" as the first way into the
control panel and the cost page (OpenSpineConsortium/openspineconsortium.github.io, site pull
requests #20, #22 and #23; master 009109c). They are kept here, beside the sign-in service they
test, so a later session on any account can run them again. Their findings and the design are in
symphony-template's docs/research/control-panel.md.

CI does not run them. They need Playwright with Chromium and a checkout of the site, and
scripts/check.sh runs only signin/test_worker.mjs. Every token in them is a stand-in such as
ghu_TEST or github_pat_X.

## What is here

- `e2e2/signin.test.mjs`: 112 checks of the sign-in, run against a mocked api.github.com, a mocked
  GitHub authorize page and a mocked sign-in service at https://signin.example.test. Some checks
  run both ways in, Sign in with GitHub and a pasted token.
- `e2e2/panel.test.mjs`: the panel's walkthrough on both pages.
- `e2e2/hostile.test.mjs`: 13 hostile-input checks.
- `e2e2/assistant.test.mjs`: 20 checks of the panel's assistant (site branch claude/assistant-panel,
  2026-10-18): who may ask (write access, and the repository's workflow carrying
  .github/symphony/assistant.md), the label and the issue made once and only on a press, the
  question's state block and its size, the conditional polling (If-None-Match and a 304) and where
  it stops (a 403, three failed reads, the time limit), the action's three comment shapes as its
  source writes them (the first comment, Claude's checklist, the header that ends a run or says it
  failed), the answer's vocabulary and what the renderer never lets through, whose comment is the
  answer, the issue read again before each question and replaced when closed, one press at a time,
  a sign-in changed under the page, a watch read on after a sign-in, and Stop watching; its cadence
  constants are shortened in the served script, and a check may serve its own.
- `e2e2/graph.test.mjs`: 33 checks of the panel's Dependencies tab (site branch
  claude/graph-section, 2026-10-18; a section of the long page until the console): the chart text
  the page hands the drawing, byte for byte the two blocks symphony-protocol's board writes for its
  fixture board-epics.json (board-epics-STATE.md, copied into the check from symphony-protocol
  468fc44, and compared with a checkout by A0 where `SYMPHONY_PROTOCOL` names one), the block it
  writes for a hostile title, four titles that spell a Mermaid directive, two that hold `$$...$$`,
  which Mermaid typesets as math, and four the board folds to ASCII, "%" and "$" written as `#37;`
  and `#36;` by both (F2, and A1, which renders it again with that checkout's own
  `board.mermaid_block`; F draws them with the real library, the formulas as words), and the four blocks the
  library writes for a wider scenario (M: a second page of sub-issues, a pull request and another
  repository's issues listed under an epic, a deleted issue, a task under two epics, an issue
  labelled goal and epic), the reads made and never made (one sub_issues read per page per open
  epic or goal with sub-issues, one blocked_by read per sub-issue of an epic whose summary counts a
  blocker, none for a goal's children or an epic whose summary says none, nothing written), the
  vendored Mermaid loaded from the served site only when there is a chart, drawing both charts
  while the tab is hidden and showing them whole once it opens, the tab itself (U: in the rail
  right after Tasks, with its ARIA, opened on load by the address #dependencies, by its rail
  button, by the arrow keys and by a link), a node pressed and Centre its row opening the Tasks tab
  with the task's row centred inside that tab's own box and the words on the message line too, the
  board's own charts drawn in the Board tab and a node there doing the same (R), handed to the
  drawing as the board's own bytes (R2), drawn only where every line of a block is one the board
  writes, any other block shown as text and nothing planted on the branch board (a picture or a
  form from elsewhere, fields under the page's own ids, a directive, a link) making an element or a
  request (X), a title opening an HTML comment hiding nothing after it and a heading's escaped
  pipe read as a pipe (Y), the charts' edges, arrowheads and words showing on their ground inside
  the dark console (C and R, by contrast ratio; `NOCSS=1` serves the stylesheet without the rule
  that gives the ground, and C and R fail then), a press on a task the tables do not hold staying
  in this tab with its words here and on the message line (W), the assistant's "show
  dependencies", asked from the Ask Claude bar on another tab, opening this tab at its first chart
  and the next question naming the section (V), the window left at 0 in each of those presses at
  1366 x 657, where the page could scroll (asserted), the tables alone when the drawing
  script cannot load, a hostile title inert and a title holding a Mermaid directive drawn whole, a
  403, a 429, the cap and the rate limit's reserve each said in words with nothing half drawn (the
  cap lowered in the served script), no read at all once the open issues' answer says the token is
  under the reserve, a Refresh included (G5), nothing drawn without an epic, Refresh redrawing the new
  count, a goal listed with the epics, a repository switched mid-draw, the tables' words, the
  repository's record unread, a repository renamed, a claim shown by its open pull request (and a
  fork's not), one chart that cannot be drawn among others, the last repository taken off the
  list, and an open list cut short. Each check opens the Dependencies tab by its rail button before
  it reads or presses inside it, and a press that crosses tabs is read at once with page.evaluate,
  which opens nothing, so the page and not console-tabs.mjs is seen opening the tab. A check that
  wants the drawing recorded instead of made serves a stand-in for the library on its route.
- `e2e2/mutants/`: 123 mutants. Each `.json` is a list of [text, replacement] pairs applied to
  assets/js/symphony-panel.js. Its `.json.only` names the checks that must catch it, and its
  `.json.suite` the check file they are in, signin.test.mjs where there is none.
  `e2e2/run-mutants.sh` runs them. The 79 of the sign-in (`m*`) were caught against master
  009109c; the 44 of the Dependencies tab (`g*`, five of them for the tab: show dependencies
  opening no tab and leaving the charts' box where it was, the message line unsaid, the focus
  opening no tab, and the window not put back; eleven from the tab's second review: the message
  line said only when the press leaves the tab, a press always opening the Tasks tab, the board's
  blocks drawn whatever they hold, "$" written raw, the board's classes or quotes lost on the way
  to the drawing, the ASCII fold dropped, a draw not started from the open issues' count, a
  comment stripped across lines, a heading's escaped pipe left escaped, and the section unsaid)
  against site branch claude/graph-section at e8f7103 on 2026-10-18, where the 79 were caught
  again.
- `e2e2/console-tabs.mjs`: since the panel became a console of tabs (site pull request #40,
  2026-10-18), one tab shows at a time; each suite installs this once after launching the browser,
  and every page action, visibility read and locator action on a selector first opens the tab that
  holds it, as a person presses its rail button.
- `e2e2/shots.mjs`: the screenshots of the gate, before and after the two constants are set.
- `review-signin/` and `review2/` to `review5/`: the five adversarial reviews of the sign-in, each
  with its report (`report.txt`) and its own reproductions. The reports name the session's
  scratchpad, where they were written; the same files are here under the same folder names. In
  the fourth review, the first variant of R1 fails on purpose. It expects a tab to be signed out,
  and the page now goes on with the renewed token.
- `run-suite.sh` and `round6-*.sh`: the runners of the last round.

## Running them

1. Clone the site to /home/user/openspineconsortium.github.io. The runners serve that folder, and
   the checks read the script from it unless `SITE` names another.
2. In each folder you run from, link Playwright:
   `mkdir -p node_modules && ln -s /opt/node-tools/node_modules/playwright node_modules/playwright`.
   In a cloud session, Playwright finds Chromium under /opt/pw-browsers.
3. Run one suite: `PORT=8077 bash run-suite.sh e2e2 signin.test.mjs out.log`. Every check prints
   PASS or FAIL.
   - `ONLY=I11b,G7` runs only the checks whose names start with those prefixes, each followed by
     a colon.
   - `MUTANT=mutants/m33_noended.json` runs the checks against that mutant.
   - `e2e2/run-mutants.sh` expects a server already on port 8077, or on the address `BASE`
     names, and reports each mutant as KILLED, SURVIVED, STALE or ERROR; name mutants to run only
     those, by their paths from e2e2/ (`bash run-mutants.sh mutants/g*.json` there runs the
     Dependencies tab's).

The site sets the two constants to the live service and SymphonyBoard's Client ID (site pull
request #24). The checks set them for themselves, whatever the shipped script holds: the
configured page gets the mocked service and `Iv1.testclient`, and the unconfigured page, which the
pasted-token checks of `hostile.test.mjs` and `panel.test.mjs` use, gets both emptied. `SITE`
names the site's checkout for every check file and for `run-suite.sh`.
